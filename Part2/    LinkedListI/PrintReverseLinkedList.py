# You have been given a singly linked list of integers. Write a function to print the list in a reverse order.
# To explain it further, you need to start printing the data from the tail and move towards the head of the list, printing the head data at the end.
# Note :
# You can’t change any of the pointers in the linked list, just print it in the reverse order.
#  Input format :
# The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

# The first and the only line of each test case or query contains the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space.
# Remember/Constraints :
# While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.
# Output format :
# For each test case, print the singly linked list of integers in a reverse fashion, in a row, separated by a single space.

# Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.
#  Constraints :
# 1 <= t <= 10^2
# 0 <= M <= 10^3
# Time Limit: 1sec

# Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.
# Sample Input 1 :
# 1
# 1 2 3 4 5 -1
# Sample Output 1 :
# 5 4 3 2 1
# Sample Input 2 :
# 2
# 1 2 3 -1
# 10 20 30 40 50 -1
# Sample Output 2 :
# 3 2 1
# 50 40 30 20 10
